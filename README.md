# diffscan2

## Overview

diffscan2 is a wrapper for nmap intended to automate processing scan results
and generate reports detailing differences (differential reporting).

It has been tested with nmap 6.

## Usage

Update `nmap_scanoptions` in diffscan.py with any additional options that are
required to be sent to nmap.

Typical usage involves execution as follows:

```
	$ ./diffscan.py targets.txt user@host.com GroupName
```

where targets.txt is a list of subnets/hosts, user@host.com is the recipient
address for the report, and GroupName is a string included in the mail
subject to differentiate between different instances of diffscan2.

A state file (by default ./diffscan.state) is used between executions to
keep state on previous scans. Additionally, the nmap output is saved in an
output directory for future review if required (by default ./diffscan_out).
The -s and -o flags can be used to change these defaults.

```
usage: diffscan.py [options] targets_file recipient groupname

options:

-h          usage information
-m num      top ports to scan (2000, see nmap --top-ports)
-n          no smtp, write output to stdout (recipient ignored)
-o path     directory to save nmap output (./diffscan_out)
-p spec     instead of top ports use port spec (see nmap -p)
-s path     path to state file (./diffscan.state)
-q          Don't send email if no changes

```

## Reporting

An example report is shown below.

```
